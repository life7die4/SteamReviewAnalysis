장점 : 
전투, 보스전 둘다 재밌음
회피와 가드의 직관성과 발동속도는 만족스러움

단점 :
필드 디자인하고 밸런스가 많이 아쉬움
창을 제외한 다른무기의 발동속도가 일반몹 약공 보다도 느린건 문제가 있음
가드와 패링의 성능이 많이 좋아서 여기에 의존을 할수밖에 없어서 
전투패턴이 단조롭고 반복적임. 스킬이 이것저것 많아도 큰 의미가 없음
필드는 지나치게 넓고, 일반몹은 이렇게까지 해야되나 싶을 정도로 지나치게 까다롭고
악질적인 함정은 스트레스로 다가옴
레벨업 스탯이 그게 그거여서 특색이 없음.

단점은 단하나 카툰풍 그래픽. 호불호가 심할듯하다.

하지만 스팀덱에서 완벽히돌아갈정도로 최적화도 오져서 PC 풀옵으로 할것같다.

It takes all the good parts from those game and take away the annoying parts (like long runbacks etc.).

What I really enjoy about it:

- it is not open world. It is kind of ""Mission based"" starting from a gathering hub.
- Not a whole lot of trash mobs or traps. Everything is carefully considered (not too much to be annoying, but enough for you to keep attention on the screen)
- There is always a checkpoint before the Boss of each mission. The runbacks are literally 2 seconds.
- When you lose a bossfight, you gain ressources based on how low you got the boss (For example, when you died in the first 10 seconds you get 100 souls. If you die after reaching phase 2 and nearly killing the boss, you get 5000 souls) This way you can still gain levels when trying the boss instead of farming souls from trash. You get rewarded the further you get at the boss. The souls you lose are also always in front  of the boss arena. So you don't need to enter to get it.
- Gameplay is insanely cool. It is similar to Lies of P. Parrying sound is VERY juicy when you hit it right. 
- You gain skill points while fighting (guarding, attacking etc.). So the more you play the game and fight bosses, you increase your player power level. Gain skills and souls.
- You can ALWAYS change your skill points. There are no drawbacks or ressources needed for it. So if you put points into greatsword and want to switch to dualwield, you can change the skill points to the other weapon
- Not a lot of weapons (3 types). But the weapon variety comes from each skill tree. VERY GOOD
- flawless performance. 120 locked FPS at 4k Ultra settings on a 4080 super and 7800x3d

What I did not like

- Stamina is very scarce. If you run out of stamina, you get exhausted. The most deaths I had where due to stamina running out. It is annoying at the start. But once you get the hang of it, it gets better. You get stamina when hitting parrys or perfect evades. Some skillpoints also give stamina.
- Pre-purchase or deluxe armour is kind of very good. It is not cosmetic, it is actual armour with actual stats. At the start it is good to use. But in my opinion not so overpowered that you could say it can carry you. It helps at the start until you get combat down
- Cinematics sometimes don't have audio. I think this is a bug, but they will probably fix it very soon. They are very quick on their feet.

Conclusion:
GREAT Game if you enjoy souls-like Games like Lies of P, but without annoying run-backs and without punishing mechanics like losing ressources when failing a boss. This game encourages you to get better and rewards you for trying.

I have never experienced a game like this. It feels so good to play. Gameplay feels just perfect.

My recommendation for anyone who wants to experience some top tier gameplay and want to improve themselve without punishing mechanics.

Pros:
- Story.  It's great to have a souls-like that actually has dialogue and cutscenes.
- Visuals.  Animations and graphics are top notch.  Everything looks and feels great.
- Fast movement.  Loved this about nioh, and still love this feature here.  No walking in tar pits.
- XP forgiveness.  You still earn XP while fighting bosses (even when you die).  This means that if you are struggling on a boss, you can eventually earn enough XP to level up enough to beat them. Fantastic touch that tailors the difficulty to the player.
- Looting.  This is the aspect of Nioh I hated because of the sheer volume, but this game does a great job of trimming all of that down and makes attributes easy to follow. 
- Steam Deck verified.
- Combat.  The combat is insanely good; the parrying of sekiro, the dodging and burst countering of Nioh.  Every hit is super satisfying.
- Seriously, the combat.  It's so freaking good.

1. Game runs amazingly well with a mix of medium/ low settings at a locked 45FPS (half of the OLED's refresh rate, 90, so it's perfect). It's UE4 so no shitty shader stutters. The Deck's GPU is somewhere around the 1050Ti's performance, so if it can run it at 800p, I think any budget GPU should be able to run it just fine.

2. The weapon feedback is AMAZINGLY well done. So the things like your attacks, your perfect parries and such have a really good and satisfying sound and weight to them, just like Sekiro and Lies of P. It's very similar to Lies of P actually.

3. Game doesn't seem brutally difficult, especially for someone who's played a decent amount of soulslike titles. The parry windows are VERY forgiving, and I think anyone looking for a decent challenge should be able to enjoy the game. I'd rank it somewhere below Wukong in terms of difficulty.

4. I can't say anything about the story or the difficulty in later stages of the game since Ive only played for an hour.

- [b]Combat is incredible:[/b] Parries feel satisfying land and enemy attacks feel fair. Freeze frames for that extra juice when perfectly dodging is great, the weapons aren't too slow nor too fast, (even the great swords!) and there isn't any visual clutter or insane particle effects that disturb fights.

- [b]Leveling and skill tree is great:[/b] There's only a handful of stats to level and they're all quite clear and balanced. Normally I would invest a ton of points into one stat, but these stats actually make me want to spread them out carefully. As for the skill tree, I love the simplicity of it, once again not overwhelming me. If I see one more celestial tree with 50 thousand nodes I'm going to lose my mind. The skill tree also contains upgrades that actually matter, it doesn't boost my attack power by 1.3% but rather useful, but not required skills.

- [b]Level design has been good so far:[/b] No crazy boss walk-backs, auto soul-pick up without needing to press a button is a great QoL feature, the way the level interconnects back to previous areas and rest sites are good.

191128774,76561197999983175,610,128,389,389,389,english,"How to describe this game..

It's pretty good. I can say that much. Viper is gonna be a huge Filter, I eased through the game until him and he gave me a true ass kicking.

I'll just point out some things and what i've experienced vs my thoughts.

[h1]1. Level Design. [/h1]
It's mission based, So you aren't really lost per se, of course its up to you to explore the levels and find all the things. A game you can compare this to would be Nioh. To be honest I kind of like it like this a lot more. Too many games are trying to be Open World without making it feel worth it.

[h1]2. Consumables and Aid[/h1]
 Items to upgrade your healing capacity seem to be pretty far and few between? I think im about past halfway through chapter 4 and I've only found a single upgrade, giving me a healing capacity of 4 totals heals, which isn't a lot. it seems each one of the heals gives you around 50% ish hp which adversely is quite a lot, which can be upgraded further with healing recieved stat on gear and items.

I'm not sure if using these consumables are really worth the time to pop them and the cost to restock them. Continuing to wait for the day a souls-game releases where consumables are refreshed at checkpoints.

[h1]3. Gear upgrading[/h1]
Levelled and RNG gear. a Classic of RPGs, you can get gear that is either godly or Scheiße. I dont even see what the point of the non-set gear is personally, the stat upgrades from set bonuses seem way too good to pass over.

[h1]4. Low weapon variety.[/h1]
Basically, you only have Dual Wield (Which is depicted as a sword and axe), Spear and Greatsword weapon options. To be honest they all are pretty good and have their own certain niches to fulfill with fighting. I was stuck on Viper for a while while using the spear, but when I played more defensively with a greatsword, I overcame him after a few more attempts!

[h1]5. Levelling.[/h1]
I'm not entirely too sure if investing in stats other than HP and Stamina is overly worth it, to be honest, the damage numbers are really low, each point of STR adds like 3 damage to a greatsword, which each swing already does like 300-400, but one point of HP adds 50 health? Seems to be a way bigger return on the investment, i think? I've yet to reach a softcap or a diminishing return at 22 HP stat.

[h1]5. Skills.[/h1]
Aside from genuine playerskill, there is the alternative levelling, which is gaining skillpoints by just playing the game. This is similar to Nioh where you would play with a specific weapon and earn skill points in that category, however in this game, the skillpoints are universal, and there is also a ""Common"" skill tree which affects you universally. In particular within this tree is the ""Reflection"" skill.

""Reflection"" acts as another type of parry, but it's honestly more of an offensive type of parry, It's timing window is extremely strict, far more stricter than standard parrying, which is called a ""Brink Block"", but by god is the pay off worth it for skillful use of it. If you can [b]Master Reflection[/b], you will have [b]beaten[/b] this game. 

Another great thing is that you can freely redistribute used Skill points into other skills for free. So you can flow between weapons that you are currently using, or adapt your current playstyle.

[h1]6. Visuals and Audio.[/h1]
Game looks stunning, the graphics contain just the right amount of effects, colour, and the audio is great too. It's also done in anime style, so it's easy on the eyes too.

[h1]7. Animations.[/h1]
The animations are overall pretty good too, though there are sometimes where you will go ""???"" as you get hit by something, or certain enemy attacks are just.. wild.. to look at.

[h1]8. Combat Balance.[/h1]
The game feels well balanced in a lot of respects, The minions are weak, and die quickly, but will give you a run for your money in a group, just as it should be. bigger and elite enemies will kick your ass a bit, until you get used to them, but eventually they too will pass as fodder. Bosses on the other hand, can be a test of patience and temper. 

At Chapter 3 it feels like bosses get more and more chunkier hp values. It kind of feels like the game developers expect you to farm 20-30 levels before each boss and to pump them all into your damage stats. 

When you're bossfighting, the window of opportunity to attack between boss chains is practically nil, you can usually get maybe one or two swift attacks before you are back to brink blocking or dodging, which, by the way, if you dont do, you can't realistically win. The way to get your actual punishing window is to break enemy stance, which to do that you basically have to do [b]A LOT[/b] of parrying. Think of Elden Ring and how it takes usually around 3 parries to break a bosses stance, but in this game it takes like 30. This is where Reflection comes into play, it basically instantly breaks the bosses stance and demolishes their stamina, but it's very very hard to land. 

(I can't wait for the Reflection only challenge runs)

The only other window of damage opportunity, is to completely drain the enemies stamina, this will exhaust them. When they are exhausted, a small button to press will appear over them, and a timer will tick down, you can freely attack them during this time, to maximise damage, before finishing it with the brutal strike.

If I had to say so.. this game probably takes a lot of inspiration from Sekiro, so.. expect that in combat?

[h1]9. Gear's Visuals. [/h1]
obviously, the most important thing, is how good does the gear and weaponry look? It looks awesome, I'm not even gonna lie, i'm a 3D modeller myself and I feel very inspired looking at the designs of the gear you can wear and hold. It all just.. looks [b]epic![/b]

[h1] . Finishing Thoughts . [/h1]
The game is fun, it's challenging, it's anime, it's cool! I like it a lot.

Every detail from the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack to the breathtaking visuals—felt meticulously crafted with pure love and dedication. This isn't just a game; it’s an experience that touches your very soul.

The story is incredibly rich, with characters that resonate long after you’ve put down the controller. You’ll find yourself emotionally invested in every twist and turn, each moment unfolding in a way that feels both fresh and deeply familiar. It’s a rare gem in the gaming world where the narrative is as powerful as the gameplay.

Speaking of gameplay, it's absolutely thrilling. The challenges are perfectly balanced demanding enough to make each victory feel earned, yet never frustrating. Combat is fluid, intuitive, and each encounter feels like a dance between strategy and reflex. The world-building is second to none, with environments that feel alive, filled with secrets waiting to be discovered.

This game manages to balance the fine line between challenging and rewarding, and at no point does it feel anything short of awe-inspiring. It’s a testament to what happens when a team pours their heart and soul into their craft.

I can honestly say it’s one of the most rewarding gaming experiences I’ve ever had. If you’re even remotely a fan of soul-stirring adventures, this game will take you on a journey you won’t soon forget. It’s not just a game it’s art.

I think the vast majority of people that enjoyed Nioh will feel right at home with this game.  But for me, the further I made it through this game, the more I felt annoyed rather than challenged.  I loved the game all the way up through the 1st main area (first act or whatever it's called), but it fell off hard after that.  The game moves from having engaging fights with well crafted enemies to all the types of difficulty I do not find fun in games like these.  The combat is great, the graphics and performance are amazing, but this game does more to frustrate you than challenge you.  Examples are:

Enemies hidden around corners constantly or obscured from vision
Invisible enemies that you can only see foot prints, that then become visible right before command grab
Enemies disguised as non combatants that will attack, or sometimes command grab you
Enemies disguised as items that grab and throw you off ledges
Enemies that fly out of range shooting crap at you, that if grabbed, will throw you off a ledge
Treasure chests that explode while looting
Bats placed solely to knock you off ledges or high beams you're walking across
Rivers of poison or some other BS you have to wade through afflicting you
enemies that leave behind self guided missiles once they die
enemies leaving pools of acid type shit around after dying
Battle constantly fought on ledges, or on beams you're walking across
Holes that open up in the floor unexpectedly for you to fall to your death
snipers inconveniently located in most fights to pepper you while you try to fight
Water that kills you if past your knees
The list goes on and on..

I wouldn't mind if these situations popped up every once in a while like most games in this genre, however this game seems to take all that to a new level, and then some.  The amount of times the above type situations come into play become more and more frequent the further into the game you get.  The game more often seems to seek anxiety engaging moments rather than engaging combat, at least for me.

Here is the progression of the game:
1st act, fight all new types of enemies and have engaging boss fights.
2nd act, reuse all enemies from 1st act, except put the fights on a ledge, and put a few snipers on other side of ledge to pepper you while fighting a dude trying to knock you off, keeping you from engaging snipers.  Then after fight, place a few spots on the ground that will break if you walk on them so they can do it all over again.
3rd act. more of the same, but some great boss fights.

That being said, the game has a lot of positive things to mention that other reviews will praise the game for I'm sure, and I likely agree with a lot of it.

It's refreshing to be rewarded for a more a aggressive play-style!

I'm running the game on High settings without any issues. There's no stuttering, no slow-downs, no crashes. I'm impressed by how well optimized this is!

Pros:
- Skill Tree. Similar to GoW and Black Myth Wukong adding additional mechanics.
- Visuals and Audio. Animations and graphics are top notch. Everything looks, sounds great, and feels great.
- XP forgiveness. You still earn XP while fighting bosses (even when you die). This means that if you are struggling on a boss, you can eventually earn enough XP to level up enough to beat them. Fantastic touch that tailors the difficulty to the player.
- Story. It's great to have a souls-like that actually has dialogue and cutscenes.

Stamina does not benefit the game at all and a Break gauge similar to Sekiro would've been better. 

Review after 2 hours -> It's been alright so far. Very simple, yet stylish. It basically copy pastes all the controls and systems from Nioh but adds cel shaded graphics.

After playing the game for a good amount of time, I can finally give my thoughts on The First Berserker: Khazan, and HOLY MOLY IS THIS GAME GOOD!

[h1] Positives [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Runs great out of the box, good graphical settings and great use of upscaling tech. I'm running the game on high settings with DLSS quality and I'm not experiencing any frame dips. A plus that it runs on DX11, though this is starting to become redundant. It helps that the game is also on Unreal Engine 4 as well. Respect to Neople for still using it, goes a long way for mid-end + lower end PCs

    [*]Story is good so far, doesn't wow me in any sense, but the idea of the game taking place in a universe I know nothing about (Dungeon Fighter Online) has got me intrigued, so much so that I'm listening to all of the dialogue. As a typical souls-like player, we usually don't have time for this. I've made an exception here. Khazan and the Blade Phantom also have mean chemistry as well

    [*]Gameplay is akin to Sekiro and Nioh, Sekiro for that sweet, sweet parrying, which I'd argue sounds better here! It seems like it's more forgiving, as there's no animation delay and the window seems to be a bit longer than Sekiro's, making it easy to pick up and an extremely viable way to play. It's akin to Nioh because of the way the missions are designed, where you travel to different regions and gather gear (it's like Demon's Souls for those who've played in terms of travelling). Combat is solid, ARPG elements work well and set pieces provide players with many options and playstyles

    [*]3 weapon types - Guts Greatsword, Barbarian dual-wield and Draupnir spear, each offering their own attacks and combos. All unique, none of them are similar to each other and have different speeds and adjustments. I'm personally running the greatsword becauser it's chad

    [*]Simple and easy to follow skill tree. Game has heaps of progression systems - Khazan himself with Lacrima or ""souls,"" which you use to spend on attributes (scaling is a thing as well), mastery, where hitting and killing enemies with any weapon will grant mastery XP and points, which you just slot into the tree. Every weapon has its own tree, alongside a ""general"" tree for general buffs. Damage buffs which you get by finding these red soulstones, and these yellow things you can use to upgrade summons (yes, they exist.)

    [*]Boss battles... are COMP. Not much else to say, I won't spoil it, but they're really good. Subjective as well, if that's an indicator of good boss design. Another plus is being able to go straight to the boss if you die without needing to watch the cutscene over and over again. WE NEED THIS FEATURE IN EVERY SOULS-LIKE GAME GOING FORWARD! (You can turn the cutscenes on in the game's settings if you wish)

    [*]Game looks beautiful, love the cel-shade approach they went for here, feels like I'm playing an anime, especially during boss fights. I'm not the biggest anime person myself, but I can definitely see what they were going for here

    [*]VFX are crazy, especially the gore. It's nuts

    [*]Crafting is always a welcome addition in these games, makes acquiring gear a lot easier, especially when you're chasing a specific set of gear

    [*]XP forgiveness system - Because of how mastery works, you don't get punished for losing mastery XP as opposed to souls, so if you die to a boss over and over, you can still earn XP from fighting the boss since you can earn XP by hitting them.  Super good

    [*]EASY MODE! I am [b] NOT [/b] playing this game on easy mode (normal is the way), but there is indeed an easy mode for those who want to make the game easier. It's available at the start of the game after you die a few times, but once you commit to it, you're in it for the long run. Don't think I'll ever try it, but it just being there makes this game an excellent recommendation to those who are new to souls-likes, especially with it being melee-oriented. Haven't seen anyone hate on it, good on you guys!

    [*]I need the blade phantom's armor IRL
[/list]

[h1] Negatives [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Repetitive - Neople likes to recycle enemies, bosses and locations, more so the bosses, which as of my current playtime, is starting to become noticeable, which can be monotonous and boring for some. Thankfully they add an extra mechanic to spice it up, but I don't like it when devs just copypasta bosses and put a new coat of paint on them. The combat makes up for all of this though, at least for me

    [*]Game stutters every now and then, not to where it breaks the game though. I've only had one crash so far, but Neople are already aware of those issues, something that'll get patched in due time, either by tomorrow or over the coming weeks

    [*]Stamina being consumed outside of combat - It'd be more smoother and fun to move around without my stamina going down halfway and then fighting my next enemy with only half. Just think it ruins the flow a bit
[/list]

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
The First Berserker: Khazan is a great game for both new and veteran souls-like players. Think of it as another Lies of P success, because that's what Neople have done here: Create a fantastic game that can be made easy, has tons of progression, different weapon types, sick gameplay and a great art style that fits the DNF aesthetic so well.

I didn't even have to change my settings to low, temp is around 85-90°, no lags, no crashes, graphic looks good. Only issue is that the text is a bit small, so it's harder to read.

Now to the game. For me it's easier than Sekiro, but def harder than all the souls games. You really need to find the right balance between attacking and defending, but you also get at least some reward even if you die to the boss. There is always a bit exp (called lacrima) that drops for you.

You can also always go back and beat the bosses again and replay the stages.

The combat is lovely and has evolved as the game has gone on. Initially the game started off very soulsy in that combat was all deliberate and defence was the key, in particular the need to parry like Sekiro. Later on it became more like Lies of P as it became a nice blend of offence and defence as you become more poweful. Now it's all ARPG as I go to town on enemies and give those buttons on my PS5 controller a workout. 

There are only three weapon types, and it doesn't matter if you're using a spear and change to another spear the move-set is the same. Weapon and armor drops happen so often and you're continually getting the same gear over and over with slightly different stats. As you move along you gradually get gear with better and better stats.

WORD OF WARNING. Don't change the game to easy if you intend to play all the way on hard. I turned it to easy and the game warned me that changing would affect achievements but it didn't warn me I couldn't change it back to hard!!! However, don't be fooled easy is not that easy, I promise you.

Be far, [i]FAR[/i] more aggressive than you might be in a typical soulslike game or the Souls games themselves. There is some back and forth to the flow of things but the difference is that ""your turn"" is not going to be given to you. You have to make use of the skills, reflects, blowbacks, counterstrikes and just good old fashioned bashing a foe in the face and TAKE your turn. Once you have it, exploit it and don't give it back until you're out of breath.

BUT after I unlocked the pre order armor set (fallen star) and soul set which have huge stamina increase bonuses did I start to actually really enjoy the game.

I genuinely do not understand the design ethos to make a more character action style souls like then make the stamina so limited. Unless you do a stamina build (and that's with a pre order bonus many won't have) you can't take advantage of so much of your character's abilities. 

You can't really do combos, special moves, deflect and dodge with punishes, run through empty areas or explore as quickly, etc bc your character will just get exhausted after just defending yourself from attacks; especially with bosses or enemy mobs.

Which sucks because there's a really fun game there. I'm now enjoying the hell out of it now that it feels like I can actually engage. The stamina bar still keeps me from being spammy and make smart choices but I can now react how I'd like without a huge consequence.

You basically have a character that moves like Ryu or Wolf but has the endurance of a Dark Souls 1 character. 

It also makes any other armor pointless because I'll lose all that stamina gain. I think Wukong did this better where having low stamina doesn't mean you can't do things, it just makes them less effective.",1742955850,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True

Khazan is so fantastic in fact its almost a perfect game. There is so much to love about this game, the art direction is obviously gorgeous, there's actually a story you can follow clearly (which for a souls-like is pretty uncommon of course, it isn't necessarily a bad thing usually. It's just a refreshing change of pace this time around) and the game-play is snappy as hell, super fun. Although unfortunately it just falls short of that perfect status for me in its current state.

I have a couple of issues with Khazan. One is that it feels frankly too easy, if your a fan and are familiar of souls-borne or really any souls-like this shouldn't provide much of a challenge. A few things stand out when labelling this game too easy, For one it doesn't shake up the formula to much or almost at all. Any muscle memory you would already have from previous souls games makes a lot of the combat feel like da-ja-vu. The few times i had actually died during the first three missions combined i had noticed that you do gain souls indefinitely each time you fall to a boss, which is a bizarre mechanic. Especially when you consider they already have an easy mode you are able to switch to anytime for players who actually need the help, players who struggle are essentially rewarded a little each and every time they die to a boss. Which in my opinion artificially closes the gap between the player and the boss over-time instead of learning the enemies patterns and adapting to the best of your abilities - You know getting better from trial and error, having that sense of achievement after spending the time getting good. Its all sort of dulled down through the way they've implemented these mechanics.
The only other issue i really have is the price of the game, it feels as if this should be a $60 (AUD) at most and not a nearly $100 game. Can't exactly put my finger on it but it just doesn't have that expansiveness to warrant that sort of a price tag.

All in all though this really is a fantastic game and one of the best souls-likes you could play, It just needs a few small tweaks to difficulty. If you find this during a decent sale in the future, then its defiantly worth grabbing. Although i'm sure there will be people out there who can find enough in this game to feel justified in the full price-tag purchase.",1743085310,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True
