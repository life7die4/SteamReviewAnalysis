장점 : 
전투, 보스전 둘다 재밌음
회피와 가드의 직관성과 발동속도는 만족스러움

단점 :
필드 디자인하고 밸런스가 많이 아쉬움
창을 제외한 다른무기의 발동속도가 일반몹 약공 보다도 느린건 문제가 있음
가드와 패링의 성능이 많이 좋아서 여기에 의존을 할수밖에 없어서 
전투패턴이 단조롭고 반복적임. 스킬이 이것저것 많아도 큰 의미가 없음
필드는 지나치게 넓고, 일반몹은 이렇게까지 해야되나 싶을 정도로 지나치게 까다롭고
악질적인 함정은 스트레스로 다가옴
레벨업 스탯이 그게 그거여서 특색이 없음.

단점은 단하나 카툰풍 그래픽. 호불호가 심할듯하다.

하지만 스팀덱에서 완벽히돌아갈정도로 최적화도 오져서 PC 풀옵으로 할것같다.

It takes literally all the good parts from those game and take away the annoying parts (like long runbacks etc.).

What I really enjoy about it:

- it is not open world. It is kind of ""Mission based"" starting from a gathering hub.
- Not a whole lot of trash mobs or traps. Everything is carefully considered (not too much to be annoying, but enough for you to keep attention on the screen)
- There is always a checkpoint before the Boss of each mission. The runbacks are literally 2 seconds.
- When you lose a bossfight, you gain ressources based on how low you got the boss (For example, when you died in the first 10 seconds you get 100 souls. If you die after reaching phase 2 and nearly killing the boss, you get like 5000 souls) This way you can still gain levels when trying the boss instead of farming souls from trash. You get rewarded the further you get at the boss. The souls you lose are also always in front  of the boss arena. So you don't need to enter to get it.
- Gameplay is insanely cool. It is similar to Lies of P. Parrying sound is VERY juicy when you hit it right. 
- You gain skill points while fighting (guarding, attacking etc.). So the more you play the game and fight bosses, you increase your player power level. Gain skills and souls.
- You can ALWAYS change your skill points. There are no drawbacks or ressources needed for it. So if you put points into greatsword and want to switch to dualwield, you can change the skill points to the other weapon
- Not a lot of weapons (3 types). But the weapon variety comes from each skill tree. VERY GOOD
- flawless performance. 120 locked FPS at 4k Ultra settings on a 4080 super and 7800x3d

What I did not like

- Stamina is very scarce. If you run out of stamina, you get exhausted. The most deaths I had where due to stamina running out. It is annoying at the start. But once you get the hang of it, it gets better. You get stamina when hitting parrys or perfect evades. Some skillpoints also give stamina.
- Pre-purchare or deluxe armour is kind of very good. It is not cosmetic, it is actual armour with actual stats. At the start it is good to use. But in my opinion not so overpowered that you could say it can carry you. It helps at the start until you get combat down
- Cinematics sometimes don't have audio. I think this is a bug, but they will probably fix it very soon. They are very quick on their feet.

Conclusion:
GREAT Game if you enjoy souls-like Games like Lies of P, but without annoying run-backs and without punishing mechanics like loosing ressources when failing a boss. This game encourages you to get better and rewards you for trying.

I have never experienced a game like this. It feels so good to play. Gameplay feels just perfect.

My recommendation for anyone who wants to experience some top tier gameplay and want to improve themselve without punishing mechanics.

1. Game runs amazingly well with a mix of medium/ low settings at a locked 45FPS (half of the OLED's refresh rate, 90, so it's perfect). It's UE4 so no shitty shader stutters. The Deck's GPU is somewhere around the 1050Ti's performance, so if it can run it at 800p, I think any budget GPU should be able to run it just fine.

2. The weapon feedback is AMAZINGLY well done. So the things like your attacks, your perfect parries and such have a really good and satisfying sound and weight to them, just like Sekiro and Lies of P. It's very similar to Lies of P actually.

3. Game doesn't seem brutally difficult, especially for someone who's played a decent amount of soulslike titles. The parry windows are VERY forgiving, and I think anyone looking for a decent challenge should be able to enjoy the game. I'd rank it somewhere below Wukong in terms of difficulty.

4. I can't say anything about the story or the difficulty in later stages of the game since Ive only played for an hour.

191128774,76561197999983175,609,128,389,389,389,english,"How to describe this game..

It's pretty good. I can say that much. Viper is gonna be a huge Filter, I eased through the game until him and he gave me a true ass kicking.

I'll just point out some things and what i've experienced vs my thoughts.

[h1]1. Level Design. [/h1]
It's mission based, So you aren't really lost per se, of course its up to you to explore the levels and find all the things. A game you can compare this to would be Nioh. To be honest I kind of like it like this a lot more. Too many games are trying to be Open World without making it feel worth it.

[h1]2. Consumables and Aid[/h1]
 Items to upgrade your healing capacity seem to be pretty far and few between? I think im about past halfway through chapter 4 and I've only found a single upgrade, giving me a healing capacity of 4 totals heals, which isn't a lot. it seems each one of the heals gives you around 50% ish hp which adversely is quite a lot, which can be upgraded further with healing recieved stat on gear and items.

I'm not sure if using these consumables are really worth the time to pop them and the cost to restock them. Continuing to wait for the day a souls-game releases where consumables are refreshed at checkpoints.

[h1]3. Gear upgrading[/h1]
Levelled and RNG gear. a Classic of RPGs, you can get gear that is either godly or Scheiße. I dont even see what the point of the non-set gear is personally, the stat upgrades from set bonuses seem way too good to pass over.

[h1]4. Low weapon variety.[/h1]
Basically, you only have Dual Wield (Which is depicted as a sword and axe), Spear and Greatsword weapon options. To be honest they all are pretty good and have their own certain niches to fulfill with fighting. I was stuck on Viper for a while while using the spear, but when I played more defensively with a greatsword, I overcame him after a few more attempts!

[h1]5. Levelling.[/h1]
I'm not entirely too sure if investing in stats other than HP and Stamina is overly worth it, to be honest, the damage numbers are really low, each point of STR adds like 3 damage to a greatsword, which each swing already does like 300-400, but one point of HP adds 50 health? Seems to be a way bigger return on the investment, i think? I've yet to reach a softcap or a diminishing return at 22 HP stat.

[h1]5. Skills.[/h1]
Aside from genuine playerskill, there is the alternative levelling, which is gaining skillpoints by just playing the game. This is similar to Nioh where you would play with a specific weapon and earn skill points in that category, however in this game, the skillpoints are universal, and there is also a ""Common"" skill tree which affects you universally. In particular within this tree is the ""Reflection"" skill.

""Reflection"" acts as another type of parry, but it's honestly more of an offensive type of parry, It's timing window is extremely strict, far more stricter than standard parrying, which is called a ""Brink Block"", but by god is the pay off worth it for skillful use of it. If you can [b]Master Reflection[/b], you will have [b]beaten[/b] this game. 

Another great thing is that you can freely redistribute used Skill points into other skills for free. So you can flow between weapons that you are currently using, or adapt your current playstyle.

[h1]6. Visuals and Audio.[/h1]
Game looks stunning, the graphics contain just the right amount of effects, colour, and the audio is great too. It's also done in anime style, so it's easy on the eyes too.

[h1]7. Animations.[/h1]
The animations are overall pretty good too, though there are sometimes where you will go ""???"" as you get hit by something, or certain enemy attacks are just.. wild.. to look at.

[h1]8. Combat Balance.[/h1]
The game feels well balanced in a lot of respects, The minions are weak, and die quickly, but will give you a run for your money in a group, just as it should be. bigger and elite enemies will kick your ass a bit, until you get used to them, but eventually they too will pass as fodder. Bosses on the other hand, can be a test of patience and temper. 

At Chapter 3 it feels like bosses get more and more chunkier hp values. It kind of feels like the game developers expect you to farm 20-30 levels before each boss and to pump them all into your damage stats. 

When you're bossfighting, the window of opportunity to attack between boss chains is practically nil, you can usually get maybe one or two swift attacks before you are back to brink blocking or dodging, which, by the way, if you dont do, you can't realistically win. The way to get your actual punishing window is to break enemy stance, which to do that you basically have to do [b]A LOT[/b] of parrying. Think of Elden Ring and how it takes usually around 3 parries to break a bosses stance, but in this game it takes like 30. This is where Reflection comes into play, it basically instantly breaks the bosses stance and demolishes their stamina, but it's very very hard to land. 

(I can't wait for the Reflection only challenge runs)

The only other window of damage opportunity, is to completely drain the enemies stamina, this will exhaust them. When they are exhausted, a small button to press will appear over them, and a timer will tick down, you can freely attack them during this time, to maximise damage, before finishing it with the brutal strike.

If I had to say so.. this game probably takes a lot of inspiration from Sekiro, so.. expect that in combat?

[h1]9. Gear's Visuals. [/h1]
obviously, the most important thing, is how good does the gear and weaponry look? It looks awesome, I'm not even gonna lie, i'm a 3D modeller myself and I feel very inspired looking at the designs of the gear you can wear and hold. It all just.. looks [b]epic![/b]

Performance: Haven't encountered any stuttering, playing at maxed settings with vsync off at 1440p. Gameplay is smooth and responsive.
The gameplay offers easy/normal mode for now, which will welcome more players in the genre I guess who finds this type of game difficult. The combat in this game is fast and brutal, relying heavily on parrying, dodging and maintaining stamina(most important). The game is hard, you will die to bosses perhaps a lot of time, but it is not as punishing as other souls games IMO.

Think Nioh meets Sekiro or Lies of P. Khazan's movement and kit feels very much like the combat of Nioh 2, even down to square/x and triiangle/y being your attack buttons. Parries (or Brink Guards) are super satisfying with a pretty generous window compared to other games. Same goes for ""Brink Dodges"" or perfect dodges. Dodging is completely viable if you aren't into parry based combat which I think is nice since it doesn't pidgeonhole the player into one playstyle. The different weapons are each fun in their own way, and each one offers a completely different playstyle. Enemy variety is good so far and quite different in each stage. Stages are also much like Nioh; mostly linear with a few branching paths that typically contain loot and/or minibosses. The bosses are absolutely peak thus far. Challenging, but fair, with very intuitive movesets and tells that make them a blast to fight against. The art style is also quite unique and even though its certainly in anime territory, it's very well done and the game looks stunning.

Sekiro-Nioh hybrid with 3 types of weapon movesets (DW, GS, Glaive).

Requires perfect timed parry or dodge like Sekiro: otherwise you run out of stamina. Combat is much more methodical than Nioh, but animations/skills/combos are as fast as Nioh.

So far this game is pretty awesome! the graphics are very good, runs really well on my PC. Im not running a high end computer nor am i running the game on max settings and it looks great!
i personally havent come across any bugs yet but im not all that far into the game neither. Dont let it fool you as a ""souls-like"" because it can be played in either Normal mode(soul mode) or Easy mode(havent tried myself). 

As someone who couldnt parry the smallest skeleton enemies in all of the dark souls to save my life i am able to parry the enemies in Khazan, for the most part. The bosses ive faced have been about 3 so far have all kicked my backside, BUT its about timing but you dont always need to be perfect, just dodge or even block. 

Im loving Khazan so far, the weapons and armour look awesome too! 

I am looking forward to fight further and see how much can of whoop-a$$ i can bring. 
Word of warning though, one of the early bosses will no doubt mop you with the floor but dont let that fool you either! im no pro, it took me more than id say 10-15+ tries to beat him but persistance and using a certain type of stick weapon with a knife at the end, was very helpful! 

The only bad i would say that ive personally noticed would be parrying can suck sometimes, if youre in the middle of a combo etc you cant just cancel mid attack and parry like in previous Dark Souls like games, unless im just terrible, probably that.

The game has anime-like graphics, it reminds me of animes such as Jujutsu Kaisen or Solo Leveling. 
I believe this just makes the game even better and unique. 

[b]3: Mechanics [/b]
I'm playing this game using a Xbox one controller and so far everything seems perfect. The game responds very well, the parry timing is very fair and if you invest time learning the mechanics you feel that you get better, there's that feeling of growth and reward.

[b]4: I've never played a soul's like before, will it be good for me? [/b]
Yes, the game has two difficulties easy and normal. Easy is for new players who are getting started into this type of game and normal difficulty sets the bar high but still it is very fair, if you invest time, learn it, you'll see progress and will love the game.

The game offers intense boss fights, rewarding progression, and a satisfying loop of loot and upgrades. With fluid combat, strategic poise management, and accessible systems, it provides both a tough challenge for veterans and an approachable experience for newcomers. A must-play for fans of hardcore, Soulslike action RPGs.",1742873130,True,0,0,0.5,0,True

Some very annoying backtracking where a checkpoint (blade nexus) disappears after you complete the zone and the shortcuts also vanish. Made going back for soulstones very tedious as you had to replay the entire zone.

Graphics: 7/10
performance: 8/10
combat: Nioh
Difficulty: 6/10 (Game has an easy mode but you will not need it unless you are bad, I died twice in 6 hours)
story: Interesting so far. Readable lore from notes.
Overall: 8/10 (Likely to go up or down a point the farther I progress)

Loving it so far! combat is a lot like Nioh since it is smooth, you unlock skills based on the weapon you are using via a skill tree. Combat is also centered around parrying and dwindling the foes stamina so that you can do a big strike. It is also mission based like Nioh, and loot matters the same way. You will find loot of different rarities and set bonuses, loot also has it's own level so you will be changing out gear often. You level just as you would in a souls game; kill things, get souls, spend them on stats. Id say the game is medium difficulty. you are allowed a little bit of room for mistakes and likely wont find yourself getting 2 tapped, even by bosses unless you make a series of errors. You also get ""Souls"" when losing to a boss. so if You are stuck on one, you'll get a level every few attempts. The souls you lose on death will also drop outside the boss room which is nice. So given that information, as well as having more options and skills, bosses in this game are easier than you'd expect in a souls game. Game also runs great and looks fine. I'm locked at 120 fps and never dip below on medium high settings on a 6800xt. minor stuttering at just a couple points, nothing to absurd.",1742869641,True,0,0,0.5,0,True

The game runs smoothly at 120 fps which shows good optimization which is nice in the day and age of this looks awesome I hope my computer will make it.  Also the basics are intuitive; I started playing incorrectly but was able to figure out a the correct way without any hand holding or messages flashing across the screen.

Finally, as I am not  too far in the game, the slight increase in difficulty provides a fun way to introduce mechanics without overwhelming mediocre players (I mean myself).  Cannot wait to see everything waiting for me.

For those who are asking ""should I"" pre-order the deluxe edition or simply purchase:  if you have the money and enjoy the souls-like genre this is a must buy.
